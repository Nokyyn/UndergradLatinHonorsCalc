# Undergraduate Latin Honors Calculator

## About
Catchy title, right? <br />
This quick program calculates a student's Latin honors level upon degree conferral for undergraduate studies. <br />
<br />
New users will be prompted to enter the name and school name before reaching the main menu, at which point they will be
able to add course information, including course code, course name and final letter grade, display all currently entered
student information, remove entered course data by course code and save all currently entered information to a text file.
This text file can be used to load the data back in by selecting the Returning Student option at start up. Selecting
Returning Student will prompt for the student's name, which must be entered exactly as it was initially (the save files 
are created using the student's name). The name is case-insensitive, however, so it can be loaded, for example, with 
"Sir Robin the Brave" or "sir robin THE braVE".
